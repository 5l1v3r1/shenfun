and we integrate the equations forward in time using an explicit, fourth order Runge-Kutta method, that only requires as input a function that returns the right hand side of (ref{eq:Ginz_var}). Note that all matrices involved with the Fourier method are diagonal, so there is no need for linear algebra solvers, and the left hand side inner product equals $(2 \pi)^2 \bs{\hat{u}}$.

The initial condition is created using `Sympy`
!bc pycod
from sympy import symbols, exp, lambdify
x, y = symbols("x,y")
#ue = (1j*x + y)*exp(-0.03*(x**2+y**2))
ue = (x + y)*exp(-0.03*(x**2+y**2))
ul = lambdify((x, y), ue, 'numpy')
!ec
We create a regular tensor product space, choosing the `fourier.bases.C2CBasis` for both directions if the initial condition is complex (ref{eq:initial_0}), whereas we may choose `R2CBasis` if the initial condition is real (ref{eq:initial_1}). Since we are solving a nonlinear equation, the additional issue of aliasing should be considered. Aliasing errors may be handled with different methods, but here we will use the so-called 3/2-rule, that requires padded transforms. We create a tensor product space `Tp` for padded transforms, using the `padding_factor=3/2` keyword below. Furthermore, some solution arrays, test and trial functions are also declared.
!bc pycod
# Size of discretization
N = (201, 201)

# Create tensor product space
K0 = C2CBasis(N[0], domain=(-50., 50.))
K1 = C2CBasis(N[1], domain=(-50., 50.))
T = TensorProductSpace(comm, (K0, K1))

Kp0 = C2CBasis(N[0], domain=(-50., 50.), padding_factor=1.5)
Kp1 = C2CBasis(N[1], domain=(-50., 50.), padding_factor=1.5)
Tp = TensorProductSpace(comm, (Kp0, Kp1))

u = TrialFunction(T)
v = TestFunction(T)
X = T.local_mesh(True)
U = Function(T, False)         # Solution
U_hat = Function(T)            # Solution spectral space
Up = Function(Tp, False)       # Padded solution for nonlinear term
dU_hat = Function(T)           # right hand side
#initialize
U[:] = ul(*X)
U_hat = T.forward(U, U_hat)
!ec
Note that `Tp` can be used exactly like `T`, but that a backward transform creates an output that is 3/2 as large in each direction. So a $(100, 100)$ mesh results in a $(150, 150)$ output from a backwards transform. This transform is performed by creating a 3/2 times larger padded array in spectral space $\hat{u}^p_{\textsf{k}^p}$, where $\textsf{k}^p = \boldsymbol{l}^p \times \boldsymbol{l}^p $ and
